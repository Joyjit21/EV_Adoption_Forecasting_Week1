⚡ EV Adoption Forecasting
This project is part of the Edunet Shell4Future Week 1 Submission. It analyzes and forecasts the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) using historical data on EV registrations.

📌 Problem Statement
As electric vehicle (EV) adoption surges, urban planners need to anticipate infrastructure needs—especially charging stations.
Goal: Predict the number of EVs in future months/years using machine learning techniques.
